### Hi there 😁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on web development, learning more about the Javascript/React/Redux stack, and being a consumer/producer of REST API calls, JSON, etc.  I am successfully deploying all of the above to a single DigitalOcean droplet, where it's operating a few separate domains, and serving React front end with Node backend.  Exciting times!  (for real)
